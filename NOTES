TYPICAL DISPATCH ROUTE: /entity-type/identifier/subsystem/method

This, rather than including the entity type and identifier as arguments because
we want the subsystem implementation to look like a Role::Subsystem.  This will
make the interface more natural in Perl land, where constantly doing:

  EntityManager::Subsystem->method($entity, $arg)

would be weird.  It also lets us use the tried and true method of changing the
subsystem implementation on a per-account/list/whatever basis.

So, we'll end up with something like:

  my $entity = EntityClass->find($identifier, $context);

The context will allow us to throw a Permission error as soon as possible.
